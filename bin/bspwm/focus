# Script: bspc-focus
# Author: Henrik Lissner
# Usage:
#   bspc-focus [-m] (west|south|north|east)
#   bspc-focus south
#   bspc-focus -m west
#
# Focus the next window in direction. If -m is supplied, jump to the next
# monitor in that direction.
#
# The behavior of the base 'bspc node -f' is odd when crossing screens. It will
# focus the last selected window on that screen, rather than the window on the
# connecting edge, which is unintuitive.
